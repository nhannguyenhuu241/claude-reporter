I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you explore and analyse the JSSoundRecorder codebase.\n\nI understand this is a pure client-side web application for recording live audio, editing it, and creating musical loops using the Web Audio API. The project uses a three-module system (recording, editor, sequencer/drone) with WebWorkers and AudioWorklets for performance.\n\nI'm equipped to:\n- Search files using glob patterns\n- Search code contents with regex\n- Read and analyse specific files\n- Navigate the codebase thoroughly\n\nI'm in read-only mode and won't modify any files. What would you like me to explore or investigate in this codebase?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2545,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":164,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVGK5VXft7SoejBaFXFGV","type":"assistant","uuid":"9aad9566-dff9-450e-a8fb-6138a61c93f5","timestamp":"2025-11-19T00:36:50.156Z"}
